### Why?
* The answer is a part of the bigger picture but is not as complicated as it might seem - ***China needs to keep the money in the country***.

* With Bitcoin and crypto - the noose around the control of the market could be seen as a muzzle while the Cryptodog is trying to rear its head out of the muzzle. But one may argue that the Cryptopup does need to be put under control. But the reason may not be as superficial as many opponents of the ban argue.

* One would say that the Communist-Capitalist hybrid lovechild operates well within the constraints of the country. But the problem has originated from the fact that Chinese wealth is being syphoned out of the country, counting in immeasurable billions of dollars.

* Crypto is like fire and the closer you get the more you feel Crypto's potential - and China being the cradle where Nakamoto's child has been nurtured till it matured - is well aware of it. The market is foreseen to grow 10 times in the next decade so the possible impact is hard to foresee on the current issue of money bleeding. 
* So I believe that this was a forthcoming issue - and mind you - **it seems like China has nothing personal on Bitcoin or Crypto**, as country has been <3-ing the Crypto offspring and even included [blockchain](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) technologies in their 5 year plan not so long ago. You can see more [here](https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-central-bank-vows-push-blockchain-five-year-plan/) and [here](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/china-support-blockchain-development-new-five-year-plan/). 

### What is the purpose of this "Commie" conspiracy?

* We can see that China has a deeper interest in Crypto then many other countries, but there could be much broader scope of FUD inside the communist party looking at the long run about how the money faucets impact it's real estate market, education, local economy and employment.

#### Real estate market

* China has been working diligently on plugging the leaks on their money barrel for some time now. These examples are just to begin with and has happened before the crackdown on Crypto. See [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/economy/china-tightens-controls-on-overseas-use-of-its-currency.html?mcubz=1) when we talk about usage currency restrictions, which does come as an impediment to Chinese plans of ¥ competing with $ and € on the global scale. But this should be completely in place by 2020.
*  Talking pure [real-estate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-11-02/china-s-money-exodus) it is visible that property purchases outside the country have syphoned on estimate of over 500 billion dollars just this year alone.

#### Education
* There is over 300.000 of Chinese students leaving the country this [year](http://time.com/4569564/international-us-students/) alone with the trend going strong for some time [now](http://graphics.wsj.com/international-students/). Another separate article covering this topic as well as Chinese education system can be found [here](http://wenr.wes.org/2016/03/education-in-china-2). We can connect this trend as in many cases it is connected to the part of real-estate purchases.

* China has an education system with a good [reputation](https://www.internations.org/china-expats/guide/17854-family-children-education/the-chinese-education-system-17856), but it is a dog eat dog world. From all that emerge from this grinder - 7.000.000 per [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_National_Population_Census_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China#Educational_attainment). - China currently has 9% of Highly educated population, 14% with senior secondary education, 38% junior secondary education, 26% primary education and 4% was illiterate in 2010. But it it's an [Ant's life](https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/11/05/chinas-graduates-an-ants-life/) for most. 
* Trouble with this fact being - China has more blue-collar job offerings then white-collar job offerings at this point and from what I have seen life is not easy on any of them. 

#### Slowing local economy
* Due to the slowing local economy China has a prerogative to defend it's own national interest as it may happen that the government loses face in front their own people who have been used to the sustainable growth and development as it was happening in the last [3 decades](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022415/worlds-top-10-economies.asp) where they grew from poverty to the 2nd strongest economy on the planet. And the current slowing YoY growth poses a serious threat. It is projected that it will slow even more, down to 5.7% in 2022 from 10% YoY not so long ago. 

* If there was nothing else China needs to sustain the sheer weight of her population and I think that that could be one of the primary concerns of the government. 4% of illiterate people comes close to 50 million who most likely rely on the Big Brother to provide options for them. But there might be much more as half of the country are still village people where generations need to pass in order for things to even out. 
* I'd reckon that they are looking into options of how to utilize the capped money and to incentivize local spending to further develop industry, redevelop the countryside’s, fix it's plummeting environmental issues and keep the highly educated people employed. 

### What happens next, if there even is a next? 

* I understand and support the concept of free economy, but without it's controls this country could crack under it's own size so managing it's multiple facets becomes like really important.

* If any of my fairly limited observations are true - The October conference will not be an easy one. There is a lot of issues to shovel around in order to plot for the best course and in general a much broader aspect to consider than Crypto alone - as the government needs to be able to take the country in the direction of further prosperity. 
* I do not think this situation will impact Bitcoin or the crypto market on the long run. I think Crypto is the next Big thing - it is a living and breathing organism that faces more threats from the inside then from the outside. In one part you can see what I mean by that [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/opinion-collapse-of-bitcoins-new-york-agreement-would-have-long-term-consequences) even if it is just one opinion. Market will just move as it is not tied down by anything and if it can not operate in China it will operate in [Japan](https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-becomes-largest-bitcoin-market-as-traders-leave-china).

* Yes, China has a broad scope if issues now, environment being the top one, I'd say, from my perspective - but in this stage of economic development, most of what we call developed countries today have been in the same gutter and dirt during their uprising. To be honest, we all hold a little responsibility in this. 

* But there always is a next. The trading does continue - it just shifted from WeChat and Exchanges to Telegram, Discord as well as other Brokerage options and OTC deliveries for the in country trading. We all know how it goes with prohibition and when you tell people they **can't have something** - Yeah. Right. Even though they plan to limit the access to foreign exchanges VPN's and TOR galore through the [Golden Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project) we go at least until [FEB2018](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/11/china-moves-to-block-internet-vpns-from-2018). 

* We might be in the Crypto bubble, but not necessarily due to the inflated values but because sometimes we are not fully able to see outside the box. Long live our own personal Truman Show.

From China with love Martin S.
