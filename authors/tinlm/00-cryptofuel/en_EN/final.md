## The last great wealth distribution

We live in an era of incredible social and technological advancements. In the early 20th century we have witnessed the biggest wealth distribution in the history of human civilization. This global phenomenon was inspired by technological advancements that allowed us to build much more efficient physical and communication networks. For the first time ever, people were able to easily travel the globe and the cost of transportation dropped heavily. New economy was born from this networks and competitive market provided better and cheaper services. However the biggest amount of money was made by people that controlled the resource needed for connecting humanity. This individuals used their money to mine more oil which they would sell for a massive profit and use to protect their monopoly from collapse under the alternative limitless energy sources that couldn't be monetized. The biggest problem with this infrastructure was that the way to stay in control of the market was by stopping improvement and the business man that wouldn't conform to this structure would be pushed out the market causing further centralization. Luckily centralized structures were keeping themselves alive by creating a system that has provided survival to the system's users. That allowed them to dominate the world but without allowing everyone to contribute and change the system they were destined to collapse. Old systems are always going to be changed with the new ones, but who will improve the quality of the systems and therefore life without the central authority? Every user of the network - decentralized authorities. You. And you are already doing it. The only difference is that when you own your data you get payed for your contributions to the network.

As our knowledge of human psychology and connectivity increases, we are becoming more and more aware of how the world actually works instead of being angry that the world doesn't work in a way we want it to work. People that master this principle use it to push our culture in a direction that they know is better for everyone and they actually managed to fix the market. Instead of being based on competition, today's market is based on collaboration and synergy. The most selfish behaviour became giving. Whatever your goal in life is, there is an enormous chance that you can achieve it by giving more value than you receive. Our economy has incorporated this principle deep into its structure as the social media gave the power back to the consumers. 

History gives us the ability to predict and influence the future. Today's market is showing similar behaviors to the market in the days of industrial revolution. We live in a time when a lot of money is being created without inflation mainly as a result of the exponential growth of technology. New technology has always resulted in increased connectivity between people. As our civilization started thriving, we started to build structures that allowed trading of the resources and today, as we approach the Internet of Things, we can see incredibly much less friction in our payment and delivery systems. In the next 30 years we will witness the improvement of the quality of our lives proportional to the one that happened in the last 300 years.


## Free roads for everyone

[Blockchain technology][Blockchain] allows us to monetize open source technology. Imagine a road that anyone can use for a fee. This road will be used only for as long as it is useful. If someone builds a new road of the same value that is free to use, no one will keep on using the old road.

#### But how can you make money in this system?

It is simple: fuel. If you can sell an universal resource that can be used to travel all the roads, you can profit from building free roads. The same thing applies to cryptocurrencies. They are the fuel, necessary for data to travel through the network. You can create free software and let people create their own programs based on your software. The more your software evolves, the more users use the network and therefore your cryptocurrency. This increase in demand with the limited amount of cryptocurrency results in the increase of the cryptocurrency price and all of the previous owners of the cryptocurrency have more money.

## Who will get the wealth?

[Blockchain technology][Blockchain] has already spread through the world and its influence and usage will only grow in the future. However the most important change caused by this technology will be the cultural change. The last wealth distribution rewarded centralization and the people that got the most of the money were monopolistic business man. Current wealth distribution is based on decentralization and the people that are most rewarded in this ecosystem are smart individuals that are driven by critical thinking instead of their ego, people that are more concerned by absolute wealth then relative wealth and this people will not reinvest their money into a new gas car. They will invest it into clean energy.
