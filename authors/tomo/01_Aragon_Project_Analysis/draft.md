# Aragon Project - a blockchain based incorporation is coming
Earlier this year, young Louis Ivan [shared his new website](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13616751) on Hacker News. The title said: “Aragon – Everything you need to run your company on Ethereum”. It instantly hit the top spot and drew thousands of visits to his page. Everybody in technology world knows that getting good visibility on Hacker News is priceless. Louis and his partner Jorge knew this, and they worked hard for months to prepare for it, they wanted to share their vision in a best way. And their vision was indeed worth the attention, and as it will turn out later, it was worth more than 25 million USD which is how much they have got from investors two months later in less than 20 minutes of their ICO.

This is a story about Aragon, a blockchain project with a giant mission of enabling everyone in the world to found and start a company no matter where they live or what they do. Their vision is best presented in their own words: 
*”Aragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries. It is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum. Cap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.”*

The Aragon Network is a token-governed digital jurisdiction that focuses on creating the best conditions for true global indiscriminatory economic growth. So, in short Aragon enables you to found your company or a non profit organisation on the blockchain, detached from any state of jurisdiction, and manage your entity in the most flexible way.

## How is this even possible?
Decentralised technologies can make this possible, and [Aragon Whitepaper](github.com/aragon/whitepaper) recognizes this: *The properties of the Ethereum blockchain present unique opportunities for the creation and management of decentralized organizations, including immutability of records,transparency, and fast transactions.* Once you’ve created your company, you can start setting up the operating infrastructure: wallets, domains, databases and everything else you need to participate in the open market. Ethereum blockchain enables smart contracts to control various assets and certificates, and these smart contract themselves can be owned by Aragon companies. As the owner of a company, you control the roles and approve transactions. If there is more shareholders, you have voting power relative to your share in equity or by some other measure. By investing time and money to build high value relationships and social proof for your company, you can achieve the same and higher level of market trustworthiness and interoperability as that enjoyed by standard companies.

## Why would this work?
There are some things which are important to the normal operation of a company, but can’t be implemented quickly into new technology, these are mostly related to the functionality of a justice system. This might be a dealbreaker if you live and work in developed democracies of Western Europe or in United states, where the good framework is readily available and justice system is efficient and reliable. But if you come from any of more than [150 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) recognized as flawed democracies or not even democracies, you probably can’t wait to be able to establish and run a business unrelated to your state and local justice system. In Croatia for example, most businesses never actually use the courts in their business as it is expensive, inefficient and unreliable. In Venezuela or other countries where private business is highly regulated and regularly scrutinised, this could seem as a unique opportunity to get out of poverty. In the long run, it is actually quite possible that Aragon will provide overall better framework for your incorporation and conducting business than even the best state.

## Why is this important?
In their classic on political economy, “[Why nations fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail)”, authors Acemoglu and Robinson argue that inclusive institutions promote economic prosperity because they provide an incentive structure that allows talents and creative ideas to be rewarded. Flawed countries are known for limited access to open market and financial system, the exact definition of exclusive economic institutions. These rules are there to keep the current elites acquired positions. According to Acemoglu and Robinson’s framework, economic growth should change the economic resource distribution and thus affect political institutions. If only the people are easily able to start and run a business, avoid being expropriated or blackmailed in a way they are now, they could earn more, and support the change of suppressive regimes or exorbitant bureaucracies. We could see the greatest shift in wealth in the world in our lifetimes.

## How does Aragon work?
In april 2017 Aragon published a whitepaper which explains the key elements of the project: "Aragon is a decentralised application (shortly “dApp”) that lets anyone create and manage any kind of organization on Ethereum. Aragon implements basic features of an organization like a cap table, token transfers, voting, role assignments, fundraising, and accounting. The behavior of an Aragon organization is easily customized by changing the bylaws. In addition, Aragon organizations are extensible through third party modules that interact with the organizations’ contracts."

## The business model
Now that we’ve covered the vision and the service, let’s take a look at sustainability of the project. We have already mentioned that Aragon had a successful ICO in May this year. Aragon is an open source project with native token. Their token model is simple, Aragon dApp as a cornerstone of the network accepts payments in Aragon Network Token (ANT) only. All users of the services provided by Aragon dApp will have to pay for them in ANT and the demand for the service will drive the value of the token up. Investors who believed in the future demand for this service bought the tokens in advance of the service being actually available, and the funds gathered this way are used to finance the development of the service.

It’s important to note also that Aragon i open source project. Being open source embraces the involvement of the community and discourages competition. Founders, investors, users and general public all have vested interests in success of such project. But unlike “old school” opensource projects, token model in Aragon enables those who have backed the project early to benefit financially in the case of successful global adoption of the project. This model enables the project to aim for becoming the main platform for running a business in a decentralised world. The danger of forking off the software and stealing the users through competing network is mitigated by democratising the governance. The voice and influence of the members of the network is allocated proportionately to their value to the network. Creative disruption or change is thus embedded into the network making it generally more likely to happen within the network than by forking.
All of the codebase is publicly available with commons label on Aragon Github repository. Anyone can fork it or pull request. Team communicates continuously with the members of the community through chat, and everything important is explained in blog posts.

## Who is behind the project?
The founders of Aragon are Louis Cuende and  are from Spain. Louis is Aragon's Project Lead, he was involved in the Bitcoin space since 2012 when he was 16.
