# Peercoin – a pioneer of proof-of-stake method

Scalability, energy consumption, slowness, costly transactions – all these are potential problems that some currencies like Bitcoin are already facing. In order to generate new coins and keep the network safe, a majority of today’s cryptocurrencies are using the process that involves extremely challenging tasks of solving complex mathematical problems. That same process is known as [proof-of-work (PoW)][1] in the crypto terminology, and it requires constant work of complex computing systems that are mutually competing on who will be the first to solve that complex problem – something also known as [mining][2]. A question of long-term profitability of this approach is raised, given the fact that energy prices tend to move up, as well as the reduction of mining fee that makes a certain cryptocurrency less appealing to miners. That’s where Peercoin kicks in with an alternative approach.

In this article, we’ll be analyzing Peercoin’s key functionality, including its architecture, new coin generation concept called proof-of-stake, how to acquire coins and which projects are being developed on Peercoin’s basis. If you happen to be unfamiliar with this topic, we strongly suggest you read our introduction to [cryptocurrencies][3], as well as to the technology that made cryptocurrencies exist, [blockchain][4]. 

## What is Peercoin and how it works?

Also known under the abbreviations PPCoin and PPC, **Peercoin is a cryptocurrency that introduced the usage of proof-of-stake (PoS) method of network security**. It was conceived by the publishing of technical description ([whitepaper][5]) in mid-2012, formed by core developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal. According to that document, Peercoin, although formally based on the core Bitcoin technology, combines PoW and PoS methods. PoW had a major usage in the early stages of token generation and is now almost fully replaced with PoS method. The method was developed as a response to potential security and long-term sustainability issues of a pure PoS system.

The fact that mining reward is decreased over time can have a negative impact on the presence of extremely important miners in the ecosystem, thus enabling the concentration of mining power in one place. The person who controls over 50% of mining power can theoretically duplicate all transactions and send all tokens to his own address, thus seriously endangering the stability of cryptocurrency. This is called [51% attack] [6]. Also, the amount of energy spent in order to power special mining devices is enormously high, making PoW method questionably profitable, especially combining this with already mentioned mining reward decrease. Compensating this with raising transaction fees in order to keep the miners, however, reduces the practical usage of cryptocurrency. Miners care more about the profitability of their work than on sentimental relations to a certain cryptocurrency. Therefore, the more profitable one will automatically be more desirable for mining and, generally, more secure.

Proof-of-stake method denotes coin generation based on the amount and age of those kept in the [wallet] [7] by the user. Peercoin suggests this method as the main basis for keeping the security of blockchain network, while the mechanism of selecting the next block forger is based on the so-called *coin day*. This unit is basically the product of token amount and time they’ve been spending in a user’s wallet. The new concept required slight modification of the core Bitcoin blockchain by adding the *time stamp* of each transaction, thus making the process of calculating coin day easy. 

**PoS method unites miners and owners** so that every network participants plays both roles. It’s important to note that only coins that were kept in a wallet for at least 30 days can compete in creating a new block. As the time goes by, block generation chances are increased, but when coin age reaches 90 days, the chances are maxed out.

Peercoin solved the potential monopoly problem of users owning high amounts of coins that laid intact in their wallets for a long period of time in a very interesting way. While block generation is in process, a transaction is being processed where user that founded new block sends his participating coins to himself. This way, coin age of these coins is being used or destroyed, and the user gets block generation reward as a substitute. In order to participate in block generation again, he must keep the same coins in the wallet for at least 30 days, and the process starts from the beginning. Here we should emphasize that [minting] [8] (term for creating blocks via PoS method) reward is lower than the one for mining other cryptocurrencies, as it doesn’t involve the sum of transaction fees. These fees (currently about 0.02 USD per transaction) serve a different purpose here, which we’ll be talking about later on.

## Advantages of Peercoin 

The concept of coin age is also an efficient solver of a problem of determining the main chain after separating blockchain to 2 identical ones ([fork] [9]), in cases when a part of the community disagrees with the coin’s future development plan. A good example for that can be found in the recent [Bitcoin Gold fork] [10] that deeply divided the community, thus showing how huge amount of cryptocurrency in wrong hands, combined with the fairly new market full of inexperienced traders can endanger the whole ecosystem. Peercoin determines the main chain based on the data of “spending” coin age for each transaction in each block. The main chain is the one that has a bigger total amount of spent coin age – this is the proof that this chain is longer in existence.

Also, due to the PoS system, Peercoin is much less susceptible to potential 51% attack. Given the fact that, by keeping Peercoin in an encrypted wallet unlocked only for minting, the user makes the network more secure while also increasing his chances of generating a new block, the majority of coins is located in wallets instead on exchanges. A potential attacker would have to own over 51% of total coin age of all coins participating in minting process, which is a considerable effort due to the fact that they are located in wallets. Initially planned investment for executing such attack would quickly rise multiple times, because the price of a single Peercoin would grow significantly due to the high demand. Moreover, by purchasing an excessive amount of coins, the attacker would actually harm himself, because his actions would cause the price of Peercoin to drop if he decides to cash them out.

The most prominent advantage of this cryptocurrency is definitely its long-term sustainability due to much lower requirements towards electricity. Actually, the only requirement is having enough power to keep computers and devices that function as network nodes on. Also, transaction costs are significantly lower compared to many more known cryptocurrencies and, as we mentioned earlier, they are not given to the block founders as a form of prize.

Instead, **all transaction costs are destroyed permanently** in order to compensate and control inflation rate of the currency, which happens over time due to the generation of a high amount of blocks and associated coins. A fixed price of 0.01 PPC per kilobyte of processed transaction is defined which, combined with the coin generation via both PoW and PoS methods, results in expected yearly inflation of 1-3%. Given the fact that, along with PoS method, **Peercoin is the first currency to introduce the unlimited token supply**, so the final number of issued tokens is unknown, this system is economically sustainable in long term. Also, it is simple as well and enables many additional applications, which we’ll be talking about later on.

## Checkpoints

However, one of the most criticized functionalities of Peercoin is so-called *checkpoints*. In the whitepaper, Sunny King addresses them as “protection of history”, in case there are conditions for an attack that could take over the control over the network, such as double spending attack. King claims that development efforts in creating a distributed network of checkpoints failed, so they’ve implemented a centralized broadcasting model. In practice, checkpoints serve as a safety switch in the events of critical problems in network functionality (something like System Restore functionality in Windows).

Of course, the community tends to furiously convict any attempt in a centralization of cryptocurrency, especially because decentralization is one of the core concepts of this technology. Even Sunny King admits that checkpoints centralization was a temporary solution until a better alternative is provided. Serving as protection against attacks in the network’s early stages, checkpoints are still active, but with the network growing stronger, they tend to lose its purpose. [Upgrading the network to version 0.6][11], users have the option to opt out of receiving checkpoint broadcasts, the feature that can be turned on again anytime. It is advised to do so after the announcements of crucial updates, forks, and network changes.

## How to obtain Peercoin?

There are four main ways of getting your PPC tokens:

- Buying them on an exchange,
- Swapping for other cryptocurrencies,
- Mining,
- Minting.

The most common and probably the fastest way of obtaining Peercoins is by purchasing them on an exchange. Accessing cryptocurrency exchange is fairly simple – open your trading account, input all required information, protect them and deposit funds from your bank account. [CoinMarketCap] [12] contains the most up-to-date list of exchanges that support Peercoin, including prominent ones like Bit-Z, Bittrex, Poloniex, HitBTC, and others. By choosing trusted and reliable exchanges you won’t be wrong, and the concept of trading is basically the same regardless of your chosen exchange – you are selling your currency (most commonly BTC or some other cryptocurrency) for Peercoin.

Unfortunately, Peercoin is currently not supported by any of major exchange offices. In most cases when you need quick cryptocurrency exchange, these exchange offices are an ideal solution offering speed and fixed fees. [Shapeshift] [13], one of the most popular exchange offices supported Peercoin until recently, and the support has been shut down due to “insufficient prevalence of Peercoin”. Maybe the things will change in the near future.

For those willing to try out Peercoin mining we should note that, since it is directly based on the core Bitcoin blockchain and its SHA-256 mining algorithm, Peercoin now requires powerful and specialized machines for creating blocks through PoW method – the so-called [ASIC miners] [14]. Naturally, the question of long-term profitability of initial investment is raised, which could reach several thousand dollars, especially due to the fact that Peercoin doesn’t prefer this method.  Mining generates a block of 820 bytes roughly every 10 minutes, with the reward of approximately 90 USD per block making profitability, in accordance with the initial design, greatly reduced. For those who do want to try out mining or just get to know something more about the process, a good guide with the list of available mining pools can be found on the [official website] [15]. Of course, before actually beginning with mining, we strongly advise you to do mining profitability calculation by using one of the [online calculators] [16].

The last, already described way of obtaining Peercoins is by minting. The concept that makes you owner and miner at the same time, thus contributing to the overall network security, is fantastically described on the official [blog] [17], where you can find reasons to join in, how to enable minting on your wallet, how safe is the procedure and so on. Minting usually gets you 1% annual income of coins that are participating in minting.

Regardless of the way you choose, you definitely want to own your own wallet for long-term coin keeping. Peercoin has its own official [desktop wallet] [18] for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers that give you all key functionality regarding coin transfer and minting, but bear in mind that it requires download of whole blockchain (less than 1 GB). The official [Android wallet] [19] is there as well, and you can create your own [paper wallet] [20] for safekeeping. Also, if you prefer multi-currency wallets, [Coinomi] [21] could be a good solution.

## Projects based on Peercoin

Peercoin’s blockchain is, due to its long-term self-sustainability and constant updates following the quick technological development of Bitcoin’s core architecture, an ideal platform for creating more advanced solutions. Here lie the potential and the future of this cryptocurrency, main thanks to the immense effort of core developers. Here we’ll mention most prospective projects that are currently being developed.

[PeerAssets] [22] is a simple, blockchain-agnostic protocol used for creating and exchanging certain assets. Its role is founding the most simple and energy-efficient method of tokenizing any blockchain. This approach is different than the one used by Ethereum, where possibilities of transferring and creating assets are limited by containing unique data in transactions that can be only interpreted on the underlying blockchain. 

The greatest perks of PeerAssets are:

- Efficiency in terms of transaction size compression, freeing most of the space on the blockchain that is reserved for transaction and enabling saving of custom codes,
- Avoiding the need of introducing energy-demanding node for analyzing the whole blockchain in search for custom code (parser), by introducing payment system involving public addresses that enable quick recognition of custom codes,
- Direct advantages of running on Peercoin blockchain – fixed transaction costs, relatively small blockchain size, security, and maintainability, 
- The low price of custom code execution due to the blockchain structure and the size of freed space.

On the other hand, [Indicium] [23] is a decentralized autonomous company (DAC) based on PeerAssets protocol, with the aim of creating and trading cryptocurrency indexes. Actively present in the world of finance since 1974, indexes represent a relative change of stock prices of several grouped companies, representing a specific portion of the market. As an example, a 2% index increase means that each underlying company saw an average of 2% stock price increase. 

By using the blockchain’s security and immutability as advantages, as well as the universal character of PeerAssets protocol, Indicium plans to apply index trading to the world of cryptocurrencies. Through its own Indicium (IND) token, users will be given a stake of ownership in a company which gives the right to dividend payout, as well as to vote on executive board elections and operations. Imagine the hedge fund with complex automated trading algorithms for cryptocurrency trading, with risk minimization and decentralized decision-making system, and you’ve got yourself a basic outline of Indicium. 

The design dictates that a majority of value will be stored in cold wallets, while the smaller portion will be used for trading on exchanges. Unlike its Slovenia-based competitor Iconomi that is more focused on cryptocurrency baskets created by users, Indicium relies on the powerful algorithms and automatized baskets creation. The good news is that Indicium successfully completed its first round of investments, so the work will surely be continued. 

## Conclusion

We won’t overdo it if we say that, in past five years, Peercoin has come a long way. Since its inception, initial creator Sunny King didn’t abandon the project and still serves as an active member of development team. Today, Peercoin’s team consists of five main developers that have the right to commit new code, with more enthusiasts joining in. Recently, a new version came out, adding some new possibilities to existing qualities. With new development strength, accompanied by projects like PeerAssets, Indicium and many upcoming ones, the future of Peercoin looks bright, especially with the growing mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. It will be interesting to follow up its future development, both in terms of innovations and market value. 

If you want to learn more about Peercoin, track its progress or contribute to its development, the good news is that its team is extremely active in communication with the community. We advise you to check out their [Telegram][24] channel, where you can ask questions directly to developers. Also, the latest news is often published on their official [forum][25], as well as on [Twitter][26].
