Tokens are a very important part of Ethereum ecosystem, but why are they useful and why would we want to have them and use them? That question has a really simple answer on which we'll give an answer to today.


## What is it useful for?

Tokens on Ethereum can have uses like loyalty points, event tickets, counting working hours in a company, voting rights, discount coupons, digitalizing fiat currencies like USD and EUR, it's even possible to digitalize gold.

## How do I make my own token?

On the first glance, it looks very complicated,  even impossible to non-tech people, but it's up to us to demystify the process which is quite simple.

### 1. Download the Ethereum client

Download  [Ethereum Wallet or Mist] client on your computer, make sure you download the right one for your operating system.

On today's example, we'll use Mist.

### 2. Start the client

As we open the client, we'll be greeted by something like this.

We'll choose the network we want to use.

### 3. Creating an account
  3.1 After we choose the network, we're going to have to create an account by typing a password of our choice that will give us access to the account later.

  3.2 The network will start to synchronize, the initial synchronization might take a while, so feel free to grab some coffee.

### 4. Funding the account
 After the initial synchronization, we're going to deposit some Ether into the account because transacting on the network requires a small fee.

### 5. Setting up the token

   5.1 After we deposit Ether into your account click the Contracts button.

We can use our newly created token however we want.
