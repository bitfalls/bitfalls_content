Along with [buying][sell] and [selling][buy] cryptocurrency, we also offer portfolio management services.

In both of the below cases the full amount of your currency is insured and cannot be lost.

## HODL

In case you're not feeling confident enough in your own [safekeeping skills][paranoid], feel free to send your crypto over to us for [HODLing][hodl]. The minimum amount is $1000 in fiat value.

All amounts are stored on a dedicated [Ledger Nano S][ledger] device (one per customer) which is the absolute pinnacle of cryptocurrency storage security. An additional [paper wallet][paper] is generated as well, and stored into a fireproof and waterproof safe in a location far from where the device is. The word combination for restoring Ledger data is split into two (12 words on each paper), each piece stored in different locations. After your currency has been secured, we'll give you the public address of the account so you can always check that the money is still there, set up alerts, and do whatever else you want with it - even top it up with more cryptocurrency.

Once you've had enough HODLing, you can do either of the following:

- [buy the Ledger][ledgershop] your currency is stored on and assume full control. If necessary, we'll assist you in changing the Ledger's data in such a way that we'll no longer be able to access your money.
- send us a request along with a public address to which you'd like the funds withdrawn, and we'll process it.

Storing the currency will cost you a one-time fee of 2% of the value being stored (applies to top-ups as well - each top up will cost 2% of the top-up). Any sending from the address to another one is charged 1% + transaction fees (this includes the final withdrawal) and can take up to 2 days. This model is designed for long term HODLers and is supposed to simulate a [_savings_][hodl] account. It's recommended for people who want their cryptocurrency to appreciate over a longer period of time, like 5 or 10 years.

_Note that because of the paranoid level of security involved with storing the currency on our end, withdrawal might take up to two days. It is analogous to keeping gold in a bank's underground vault._

## Trading

We can also day-trade for you. If you have a certain amount of cryptocurrency you'd like to day-trade with (read: gamble) to increase your holdings, we can do the following:

- you send in the amount (minimum of $1000 fiat value)
- we take 5% immediately, or 3% for $30,000+
- we take 1% off of every trade
- we take 1% + transaction fee when you're withdrawing the amount back to your own wallet

The commission is higher in this case because of a more relaxed security: exchanges can disappear overnight and we'd have to cover the losses from our own accounts (remember, you cannot lose your money due to fraud, scam, or robbery - it is insured - you can only lose on bad trades), so the risk is greater. The profits are potentially greater, too. Given that our profit depends wholly on the money we earn for you, you can be certain we'll do our best to accommodate and trade quickly whenever necessary.

This plan is recommended for people who don't want their identities tied to large winnings on exchanges (Bitfalls trades for you, as an official entity), people who aren't often by the computer and can't react quickly, people who can't read trade graphs or just aren't comfortable with exchanges, etc.

_Note that this service does NOT include investment advice. Our only role is to execute orders you send in. You are responsible for those orders. Additional details are arranged during the collaboration's initiation._
